Chapter 9: 
chem bonding notes:
 - Ionic bond = metals and non-metals bonding
 - Covelant bond = non-metals and non-metals bonding
 - Metalic bond = metals and metals bonding
 
In the case of an Ionic bond, valence electrons from the metal ion will transfer to the non-metal ion.
 - lattice energy = LE = abs(net energy of rxn)
 - creating an Ionic bond has a net negative Lattice Energy, is exothermic
 - breaking an Ionic bond has a net positive Lattice Energy, is endothermic
Born-Haber Cycle (Hess' Law)
 - Some helpful tips:
    - write out each step of hess' law using coloured markers (this will help to keep each step in your mind)
	- short digression:
	 - the born-haber cycle is expressed as follows in common reactions: 
	    1. Reactant bonds are broken (+BE)
		2. Reactant atoms reform (-BE)
		3. Always remember: hess' law requires keeping your mind on stoichiometry, DO NOT FORGET THE COEFFICIENTS
		4. Hrxn = H bonds broken + H bonds formed
		5. There may be more steps if atoms within the final compound first have to form gaseous ions.
Coulomb's Law
 - Electrostatic energy = (charge1 * charge2)/distance
 - size: smaller atoms have larger lattice energy
 - larger charged atoms have larger lattice energy
Properties of Ionic Compounds:
 - Physical: hard, rigid, and brittle (this is due to electro-static repulsion on ionic pairs)
 - Thermal: high melting and boiling points, vaporize in pairs
 - Electrical: solids do not conduct but liquids and solutions do 
 
In the case of a Covalent bond:
  - there is a balance wherin attraction and repulsion between electrons and atomic nuclei are at balance
***The only important thing to remember - covalent bonds share atoms, ionic bonds transfer atoms***
  - types of covalent bonds:
   - single bond = lone bond
  - read more about potential energy well
  - Covalent radius = distance between the nuclei in a covelant bond /2
  - Bond length parallels atomic size, larger atoms will have larger covelant radius
  - Stronger bonds have larger bond energy, weaker bonds have lower bond energy
     - this is due to the trends in energy wells
  - Variation within a group:
	 - the trend in single bond length parallels the trend in atomic size, opposide to bond energy
  - Variation within a period:
     - trend in bond length parallels trend in atomic size, opposite to trend in bond energy
The sum of the enthalpies to break bonds and to make bonds are equal to the change in enthalpy over the reaction

Note on lewis model: lewis model shows the number of valence electrons as a series of dots around an atom
 - a transfer of electrons in a bond is represented through the a shared outer layer (dots)
